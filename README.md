# typescript-expo-apollo-boilerplate

Clean boilerplate for TypeScript + Expo (React Native) + React Apollo (GraphQL)

## What is this?

This is example base code to use React Native and GraphQL.
We use Expo to ease building the environment.
We use React Apollo to use GraphQL.
We use TypeScript instead of JavaScript for static type checking.

## Features

- minimal code without extra configs
- no-any/noImplicitAny configs for TypeScript
- client-side mocking for developing before building a GraphQL server

## How to run

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
git clone https://github.com/dai-shi/typescript-expo-apollo-boilerplate.git
cd typescript-expo-apollo-boilerplate
npm install
npm start
```
